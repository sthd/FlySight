## Project Goal and Background
We examined the possibility of analysing spatial motion using simple sensors and a reduced calculation cost.
The algorithm is based on successful EMD-based applications that were founded on the The *Drosophila vision model* a.k.a **EMD** that was presented by **Hassenstein** and **Reichardt** in 1956

## The Algorithm
The EMD we implemented takes two signals
